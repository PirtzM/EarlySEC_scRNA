### Data Availability
`Seurat Objects`: data objects for quick analysis of cell types within the mouse uterus at different stages of SEC progression and CellChat analysis. [Dryad]() [active upon publication]  

`Raw Data`: raw and processed scRNA-seq and Visium data for the mouse uterus at normal, pre-dysplastic, and dysplastic stages of SEC. (GEO accession number) [active upon publication]  

Note: All Visium analysis was completed using LoupeBrowser7. Aligned files for analysis are available through [Dryad]() [active upon publication]

### Subdirectories
`Data_Preprocessing`: quality control and object preparation for all cells and epithelial subsets of combined datasets and normal, pre-dysplastic, and dysplastic datasets. Preprocessing is also including gene expression analysis and cluster renaming.

`Figure_Scripts`: code for recreating figures from the manuscript. 

`Data_Analysis`: code for recreating differential expression analysis used for identifying genes of interest in the manuscript.

`Reproducibility`: data alignment and R session information to recreate conclusions.
